        management, systems administration, open source, IoT, 3D printing, blockchain, 
        AI/ML and a lot more.
        
        Dubbed as DevCon and hashtagged on social media as #DevConMu, the conference
        spans over three days of activity, presentations, workshops and networking.
        The first two days culminate with a Happy Hour networking session where everyone
        can chill & share a fun moment. Nonetheless, it is also the time when business 
        opportunities may arise.
