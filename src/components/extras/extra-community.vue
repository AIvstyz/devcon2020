        Take the chance to exchange with other attendees, have some interesting
        conversations about software development, latest information gained
        during one of the presentations and let others know about your ups &amp;
        downs in your projects.

        The coffee breaks and Happy Hour are just the right moments to maybe
        make a new friend. Think about it.
