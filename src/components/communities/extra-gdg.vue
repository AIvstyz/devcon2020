      The GDG Mauritius is a local community-ran meetup for developers
      interested in resources and technology from Google Developers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The MSCC has an annual event called the Developers Conference which is
      free of charge community-driven, IT tech conference hosted annually in
      Mauritius. Since 2016 there is an extra venue at the Flying Dodo.
    </p>

    <p>
      GDGs are local groups of developers who are specifically interested in
      Google products and APIs. Each local group is called a GDG chapter and can
      host a variety of technical activities for developers - from just a few
      people getting together to watch our latest videos, to large gatherings
      with demos and tech talks, to hackathons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disclaimer: GDG Mauritius is an independent user group; our activities and
      the opinions expressed here should in no way be linked to Google, the
      corporation.

    <p>
      Come join us at Developers Conference 2020 __ROOM__ of Caudan Arts.
